Rock Paper Scissors - browser game with simple UI

I haven't deleted the console.log messages on purpose. They serve the
role of a "round history". The code looks a bit cluttered because of
that, but it's an acceptable trade off this time.

The game is self-explanatory, I hope.

I've replaced the plain old buttons with some funny images and added
some button animations for improved interactivity.

If I have missed some bugs, I would appreciate some kind of feedback.
